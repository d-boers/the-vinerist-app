# The Vinerist

## Overview

The Vinerist is a React application that aims to be a social database for vintage and winery reviews in the Naramata region.  This app was built as my capstone project for the BrainStation program over a two week period.  The application itself is built with:

* React
* Node
* MySQL
* Prisma

## Inspiration

I was looking for a project idea to practice CRUD functionality, and remembered a recent stay at a friend's B&B in Naramata wine country.  During the stay they mentioned that despite having a thriving community, there was no central online hub that allowed visitors to connect over their experiences.  I decided to create a central repository where users could upload reviews of vintages and wineries and connect over their shared interest.  Beyond the standard CRUD functionality I figured it would also allow me to experiment with a number of third-party features, everything from drag and drop image uploading, to interacting with Google Map's API for location info.  Also, wineries are beautiful, and from a design-level I knew it would be enjoyable to build and try to capture that aesthetic.

## Functionality

With the short timeline given to complete this work, I focused on the core pieces of functionality and implemented the following features:

### Users are able to...

* Add new wineries with detailed information to the database
* Add new vintages associated with specific wineries
* Review wineries by ID
* Review vintages by ID
* Upload images of vintages and wineries and avatars

## The Vinerist 2.0

After the initial submission of our projects we had an additional week before presentation.  During this time I decided to challenge myself and see if I could quickly iterate another version.

I focused on adding authentication and integrating Google Map's API for location features.  The latest codebase reflects these changes
